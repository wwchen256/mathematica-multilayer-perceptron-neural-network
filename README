This is a Mathematica implementation of a multilayer perceptron, also known as a neural network.

All activitation functions are sigmoidal, making the perceptron only suitable for classification.  Two sample data sets are included: the classic XOR problem and SP500 stock market data.  

The XOR data is formatted as three values, the first two are inputs, the third is the output.  For example, the statement True XOR True = False is encoded as 1 1 0.

The SP500 data is formatted as a row of 5 values, the first four being a +1 or -1 indicating whether the index has risen or fallen on consecutive days.  The last value is a +1 or -1 indicating whether the index has risen or fallen on the fifth day.  A rising index is defined as one that has increased more than 15 points, whereas a falling index is one that has decreased more than 15 points.  The value of 15 is the standard deviation of the index over the 2 year period of the data.
